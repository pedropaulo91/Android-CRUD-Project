# Android-CRUD-Project

This is a basic CRUD project created for a college work. 

It stores data in a single table called "veiculo" with a primary key column named "_id" and a unique column named "placa".

It uses ListViews for displaying data through SimpleCursorAdapters with a customized layout.

This app was developed using Eclipse ADT. I created a new branch with the Android Studio version of the app and some corrections.
